Does not have to be programming related, I don't use a lot of social media so this acts as a forum of sorts.

- Maybe [search my wiki](https://purarue.xyz/x/?search) in case I've already written about the topic.
- If you want to just leave a comment, [sign my guestbook instead](https://purarue.xyz/)!
  - If you want to ask a private question or comment, you can also leave your email in the guestbook, the comments are hidden till I approve them.

### Guidelines

- Use a meaningful title.
- Bugs & feature requests for other programming projects should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Be nice :)
