Does not have to be programming related, I don't use a lot of social media so this acts as a forum of sorts.

- Maybe [search my wiki](https://purarue.xyz/x/?search) in case I've already written about the topic.
- If you want to just leave a comment, do that in [my guestbook instead!](https://purarue.xyz/).
  - If you want to ask a private question or comment, you can also leave your email in the guestbook, the comments are hidden till I approve them.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite.
